# Movie-Night-In

An Application to help you decide on what movie to watch by pulling information from OMDB API. The application displays a matching movie result for the search criteria in the form of a poster, short plot synopsis, and a GIF related to the movie. Some additional functionality is the ability to save movies to a watchlist for later reference. The watchlist is saved to local storage, and can be cleared at the push of a button. Some challenges faced in the development of this app were adjusting to using both OMDB and Giphy API. As well as using a new css framework when we had become so accustomed to bootstrap. Looking to the future, a more robust randomizer could be created with the help of a webscraper to pull data for top 100 movies. We could also stand to clean up the javascript a bit and reduce some redundancies.
